# PCI compliance

## Overview

If you're processing payments, transmitting and storing card data, you must comply with the  [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards)  (PCI DSS).

_PayCore.io Ltd company is certified for PCI DSS as a Level 1 Service Provider._

PCI compliance is a responsibility shared between both us and your business. So when accepting payments, it is essential that you do so in a PCI compliant manner. The complexity of this depends upon your integration methods, but the simplest way is never to see or access your customers' card data. Here are our tips:

-   Use one of our integration methods that allows you to accept payments without ever handling card data:  [Frames](#)  and  [payment.widget.js](/integration/payment-widget-js).
-   Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all payment pages, so that they use HTTPS.
-   Review and validate your PCI compliance once a year.

## Validate your PCI compliance

All of our merchants must validate their PCI compliance annually. Most can do this with a  [Self-Assessment Questionnaire](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=saqs#results)  (SAQ), which is provided by the  [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

The PCI requirements for our integration methods are as follows:

-   payment.widget.js and Frames:  **Pre-filled SAQ A**
-   Mobile SDK:  **Pre-filled SAQ A**
-   Full card details:  **SAQ D**

If you have any questions or are unsure about PCI compliance, please contact your customer success manager.
