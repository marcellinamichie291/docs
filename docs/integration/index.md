## Basic principles

We offer a great deal of payment products and services, each with its own options and possibilities.
Before you get started there are a few things you really need to know in order to get the integration in place that fits best with your needs.

Get the answers straight:

??? question "Which payment products do you want to offer your customers?"
    The PayCore.io platforms offer the widest range of payment methods of any payment service provider, from global card processing to specialized local payment products your world wide audience likes best. Have a look at the options we provide.

??? question "Do you want to handle sensitive credit card information yourself?"
    Our platform offers SDKs and the Hosted Payment Pages that make sure you wonâ€™t have to bother with sensitive information.

??? question "Do you want to host your payment services yourself or let us take care of hosting?"
    You can either build your payment pages yourself using our javaScript or Native mobile SDKs on our Public API, or let us completely handle this for you through our Hosted Payment Pages. Which of these options is best in your case depends on your specific needs, and we're happy to advise.


## Accept Payments

With PayCore.io, you can build a payments flow that gives you and your customers the power of choice. Collect payment information quickly and securely, create charges server-side in over 150 currencies, or accept payments from a host of additional payment methods, including 3-D Secure, Apple Pay, and SEPA.

Read about our integration methods below, then choose the one that best suits your needs.

### [Hosted Payment Page (HPP)](/products/hpp/)

Our Hosted Payment Page (HPP) is a complete, ready-made payment UI that offers a quick and easy way to securely accept payments. The UI includes a card entry form and supports any payment method flow. When a user successfully completes the UI, your client code obtains a payment method nonce for use on your server.

Use our hosted responsive solution for payment processing:

-   Least effort integration
-   Can be used as a standalone page or as an iframe
-   Supports one specific or all available payment methods.
-   Easy do-it-yourself styling options
-   Good for connecting to existing checkout flows
-   Responsive design on mobile

    We reduce your PCI-DSS burden by handling and validating your shopper data on our payment pages.

    **What we do**

    -   Collect the shopper's payment details
    -   Process your shopper's payment

### [Self-hosted payment page](/integration/self-hosted-payment-page/)

Before you can make a payment with our API integration, you need to collect any required payment details from your shopper. Here we describe how to do this by building your own payment form.
Building your own form gives you full control over the look and feel of your checkout. If you'd rather not build your own payment form, you can also collect the shopper's payment details using our pre-built JavaScript Components. These are available for many popular payment methods.

Build and host yourself using SDKs or client API:

-   Full control over design
-   Users stay in your application/domain
-   Easy best-practices based development
-   Available for many platforms

??? question "What we do? What you do?"
    You can manage shopper data and the shopper journey within your own environment.

    **What we do**

    -   Process your shopper's payment
    -   Carry out changes/modifications to the payment
    -   Notify you of payment status changes
    -   Respond to your queries about the status of an order

    **What you do**

    -   Collect details of the items your shopper wants to buy
    -   Collect the shopper's payment details (such as cardholder name and card number) and their chosen payment method
    -   Send the payment to PayCore.io

## Callbacks

Callbacks notify you about events that occur with regards to the payments that you process via PayCore.io, like status changes on payments. This allows you to be easily aware of things that happen, even after the consumer is no longer on your site.

## Full API References

We offer several RESTful APIs: A server API which is used by the merchants in a server-to-server setup and a client API which is used by clients like desktops, laptops, mobile phones and other internet connected devices. For both APIs we offer a detailed API reference that lists all the functionalities and how to use them.

### Commerce

#### HPP API

[<i class="md-icon">explore</i> Swagger HPP API Specification <i class="md-icon">launch</i>](https://swagger.paycore.io/commerce-hpp/)

#### Public API

The Public API enables mobile phones, browsers, and apps to access the hosted data such as detailed information about the available payment methods, services metadata, and public keys used for encrypting sensitive data. These calls require a Public Key that the merchant can create using the Private API.

[<i class="md-icon">explore</i> Swagger Public API Specification <i class="md-icon">launch</i>](https://swagger.paycore.io/commerce-public/)

#### Private API

The Private API enables merchants to access functionality such as payments, initiating hosted payments, creating profiles, and much more. All these calls require the caller to have a secret API key that merchants can look up in their Commerce Account.

### Platform

#### Core API

The Core API allows you to programmatically manage your PayCore.io account. It does everything the Dashboard UI does, but adds some capabilities that may come in handy depending on your business needs. 

Consider, for instance, a business model in which you provide a service that allows other merchants to accept payments (like in a marketplace). Using the Core API you can create a Commerce accounts on behalf of each merchant, under the umbrella of your main account.

#### Cardgate API


The Cardgate API is Full card details API integration lets you accept payments on your website and mobile application, if you support PCI compliance at Level 1 or 2. This tutorial explains how you can collect raw card data from your shoppers and pass this data in payment requests to the Cardgate API.

When you want to reduce your PCI compliance requirements, we recommend that you integrate with our Client-Side Encryption library instead.

#### Cardgate HPP API

Using Cardgate HPP for card payments you can process transactions using PayCore.io, our easy to use hosted responsive payment pages. Your consumers will be able to complete the payment process using Cardgate HPP that is hosted by us. Using these pages to capture card details and process card transactions will greatly reduce not only your integration efforts, but it will also reduce your 'PCI exposure' to the lowest level (SAQ-A).

### Postman Collections

While being able to build requests using a GUI is nice, Postman really starts to shine when you use collections. Postman Collections are simply a collection of pre-built requests that can be organized into folders, and they can be easily exported and shared with others.
