Cheery Greetings from [PayCore.io](https://paycore.io/)!

Our dev team continues working on system polishing and enhancement. These two weeks, we have been focusing on optimising the number and sequences of payout scheme checks and boosting up front-end performance. Hope, you will be able to assess the results of our efforts very soon; in the meantime, present you short notes about other meaningful features in version 1.20.
