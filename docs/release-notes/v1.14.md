## List of Changes

### Rolling Reserve

What is a *Rolling Reserve*? A rolling reserve is a type of reserves that withholds a small percentage of all of a merchantâ€™s gross sales in a non-interest-bearing account for a predetermined amount of time before releasing the funds to the merchant. Payment processors may use rolling reserves as a risk management tactic for high-risk merchant accounts.

You can set up the reserve rate (in percentage) and continuance (in minutes) for every commerce payment service you use.

After turning-on reserve, these services are marked with a clock icon in the service scheme's list. Move the mouse over the icon to see a tooltip.
