Cheery Greetings from the [Corefy](https://corefy.com/) team!

We keep enhancing our products. This month we've focused on boosting their efficiency and adaptability.

## Highlights

* [Provider accounts update](#provider-accounts-update): added possibility to check account credentials from the Dashboard
* [Commerce updates](#commerce-updates): added the *Auto-approve* option for transactions  within an organisation, added the *Resolution message* attribute for payment invoices
* [Card gate HPP update](#card-gate-hpp-update): added the theme option for customer redirection only after final statuses
* Performance improvements

## List of changes

### Provider accounts update

#### Connected provider account's credentials 

From now on, if the organisation have several connections to one provider, users with relevant permissions can check account credentials directly from the *Dashboard*. Go to the *Provider accounts* -> *Account's overview* and review parameters under the *Details* section.

### Commerce updates

#### Auto-approve for transactions within an organisation

We expanded capability of managing transactions within an organisation, and now users with relevant permissions can choose the *Auto-approve* option and process the transaction right after creation.

You also can use the API request.

    API: Commerce Private

    Endpoints: 

    - `/deposits` 
    - `/transfers` 
    - `/withdrawals`

    Method: POST

??? example "Request example"

    ``` json hl_lines="12"
    {
        "data":{
            "type":"operation-deposits",
            "attributes":{

#### Resolution messages for payment invoices

A resolution is a transaction status clarification and may inform about possible errors during processing. So for these purposes, we added `resolution_message` as an attribute for payment invoices reconciliation.

You can find it in the payment invoice's overview on the Dashboard and Merchant Portal and get in the API responce.

        "links": []
        }
    }
    ```

!!! note

    The detailed level of the transaction's failure reason depends on the information openness of payment service providers (PSP) and issuer banks (for card transactions). And the finality and success of the transaction processing are determined solely by the payment status (`status`).

### Card gate HPP update

#### Redirect only after final statuses obtained

To fix several troubles with iFrame and lightbox pages, we've reviewed the redirection logic for the Card Gateway HPP. Moreover, we've added a new option, `redirect_only_final`, that you're able to use with your themes.

![Card Gateway options](images/v1.103-1.112/theme-option.png)

The HPP has 5 seconds to check transaction status and send a message event to the page event listener. If the `redirect_only_final` value is `true`, it redirects a customer to specified Redirect URLs only after getting one of the final statuses (like `processed` or `process_failed`).

Otherwise, it redirects after getting final or transitional statuses (`process_pending`) as by default.

### Performance Improvements

Of course, we fixed several bugs and now hope, you mentioned the enhancement of the platform's productivity.

Stay tuned!
