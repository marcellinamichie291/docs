Cheery Greetings from the [Corefy](https://corefy.com/) team!

Our main priority for this month was streamlining, and we made a series of tiny decisions for code refactoring and bettering our products. Most of them go unnoticed, though we've also got changes to light up.

## Highlights

* [Processing supplements](#processing-supplements): added partial statuses for payments' refunds and chargebacks, and an option to skip the verify stage on payouts
* [Card Gate](#card-gate-update): added possibility to update features for connected merchant accounts in the Dashboard
* [Merchant Portal](#merchant-portal-updates): configuration and exports updates
* [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)

## List of changes

### Processing supplements

#### For payments

We added `partially_charged_back` along with  `partially_refunded` to the payment status list.  Both status types are considered final for now: but in future updates, we're going to add the possibility to request partial refunds until the transaction sum becomes zero equal.

#### For payouts

The requisite verification stage is an optional part of a transaction flow. But it's not always possible to examine requisite existence in a provider database due to data transport errors. Time and money can be lost, and to prevent such situations, we added the commerce option, which allows us to initiate skipping background verification at payout transaction processing.

Find this option in *Commerce account settings* --> *Payouts* --> *Payout options* and use with caution.

### Card Gate update

Suppose you didn't specify some feature at connection, but they are available for your account at the provider side. In that case, you don't need to reconnect but only go to its details, use the new option and edit features in the  *Dashboard* (*Card Gate* --> *Merchant accounts*).

### Merchant Portal updates

#### Logo and favicon uploader

Now when you set up the merchant portal, you can upload its logo and favicon at once. Options aren't mandatory but helpful if you want to improve the portal's style.

The supported file formats:

* Logo: `.svg` and `.png`
* Favicon: `.svg`, `.png`, `.ico`

#### Export usage update

We've improved the generation of the *Exports* based on the Portal user's timezone. So now, you don't need to manually add your time difference with UTC (default time value); just set the timezone in the user profile settings.

### Performance improvements

We've also made various minor performance improvements and related bug fixes.

And that's all news for today. Stay tuned for the following updates!
