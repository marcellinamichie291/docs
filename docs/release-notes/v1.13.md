## List of Changes

### Tokenisation Process Upgrade

A little news on the platform's internal improvements: we separate two types of tokens. Now we have public tokens for using in the Checkout process with the *Remember me* optionâ€”and private tokens for card predefining and write-offs.

This update does not affect the integration processes for our clients but allows us to speed up the interaction between the platform components.

### Updates for Commerce Account Management

Our dev team cleaned up the *Commerce* section and added functionality for archiving accounts that already not in use. Their data is stored in a separate tab, and you can always find, view and unarchive them if necessary.

As an extension for [this API update](/release-notes/v1.6.12/#return-urls-variations), we have added a relevant block to the integration options.

And you can find the same options on the *Merchant Portal* when the *New Payment* is creating. They are automatically filled in according to the Commerce account settings, but you can modify their value in invoice.

### Dashboard UX Betterment

We waited for this from the outset and finally got the hands to do: grid tabs in the dashboard's section open as a new tab in a browser (*okay, that doesn't sound as cool as it might, but it still makes users happier*)!

Also, we updated inner logic of interaction with Google Pay UI.

### Bug Fixes

We are polishing up our platform now, so it's not surprising that we find a lot of tiny things that can be developed or fixed. And thank our clients for help in these improvements!
