## Highlights

* [Commerce updates](#commerce-updates): made invoice reference ID optional so now generate UUID randomly
* Updated [addon creating](#addon-updates)
* [New Analytics tables and columns](#new-analytics-tables)
* Updated [Telegram bot](#telegram-bot) functionality
* And other performance improvements

## List of changes

### Commerce updates

#### Optional invoice reference ID

Did you have trouble coming up with a unique Reference ID while a new invoice creating? If so, forget about it. The creating form randomly generates a universally unique identifier (UUID) for you, and the system'll send that one ID if you don't want to replace it with yours. And we've also made this field optional.

### Addon updates

We've [further updated](/release-notes/v1.83-1.93/#addons-update) the form for a new addon connecting by increasing its functionality.

    Please check them with your account manager.

### New Analytics tables

From now on, you can add to queries extra tables for batch payouts: `com_payout_batches` and `com_payout_batch_items`.

We're also added the column `processed_route_id` for the `pg_payments` table.

### Telegram bot

And here come good news for Telegram and, specifically, our Telegram bot users. Now you can choose the account you want to get info about by turning pages in the general list and finding it by the ID, name, or reference ID.

### Performance improvements

We put a lot of attention on our platform's improvements, and, is as often the case, we found some bugs and needed fixes to do (yes, all these imperfections annoy us too).

Stay tuned for the next updates!
