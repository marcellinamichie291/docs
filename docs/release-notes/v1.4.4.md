# **PayCore.io v1.4.4 (November 15, 2019)**

*By Dmytro Dziubenko, Chief Technology Officer*

Happy Friday mood from [PayCore.io](http://paycore.io/)!

It seemed November 11 Sales' Rush shook the global payment system as hard as it could. As payment hub, we also felt waves of this shaking and were up in arms.

It gave us an additional motive to devote time for general system improvements (that, mostly, yet not ready for the full implementation). But our dev team also found resources for few pleasing features: check the information below to find about them.

## Highlights

* [Card Gate](#card-gate-update): added the payment retry if the bank-acquirer declined transaction with a general fatal error
* [Merchant App](#merchant-app-update): added the data export for payments and payouts
* [New integrations](#new-integrations): Exactly, Twelve.live
* [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)

## All Changes

### Card Gate Update

From now on, if a transaction is generally declined by the acquirer after passing ACS, it will be automatically sent via cascading route. Also, the customer will receive the informational message about searching for an alternative payment gateway and will be sent for payment retry.

### Merchant App Update

Similarly to [this platform upgrade](../v1.3.4/#data-export), we added the transaction data export for the Merchant App's payments and payouts. Filter desired entities and export them to .xls and .csv formats.
