# Getting Started

## Write A Query

Once you've connected a data source, it's time to write a query:  **click on "Create" in the navigation bar, and then choose "Query"**. See the  [“Writing Queries” page](../managing-queries/)  for detailed instructions on how to write queries.

## Add Visualizations

By default, your query results (data) will appear in a simple table. Visualizations are much better to help you digest complex information, so let's visualize your data. PayCore.Analytics supports  [multiple types of visualizations](../visualizations/)  so you should find one that suits your needs.

Click the “New Visualization” button just above the results to select the perfect visualization for your needs. You can view more detailed instructions  [here](../visualizations/).

## Create A Dashboard

You can combine visualizations and text into thematic & powerful dashboards. Add a new dashboard by clicking on "Create" in the navigation bar, and then choose "Dashboard". Dashboards are visible for your team members or they can be shared publicly. For more details,  [click here](../managing-dashboards).
