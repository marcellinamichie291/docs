## Introduction[](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/payment-method-overview.html#introduction "Permalink")

Chargebee offers you the flexibility to configure one or more of our supported payment methods per customer to best suit your business model, your country of incorporation and your customer base.

Multiple payment methods against a single customer offer both revenue assurance and flexibility. Revenue assurance in that if one payment method fails, you can rest assured that Chargebee will try another, with the least amount of hassle to you and your customers. Flexibility in that you can charge certain payments to a particular payment method and others to an alternative payment method.

Chargebee supports a host of options that will help you meet your customers' every need.
