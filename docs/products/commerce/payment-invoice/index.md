# Payment Invoice

## General

There are three types of **incoming** transactions that occur in PayCore.io:

- Payment 

    > A **Payment** is a low-level operation that initiates a financial transaction in the defined payment provider using the specified payment method, it simply provides communication with an external provider and the mapping of statuses.

- Request

    > A **Payment Request** is an operation with rich functionality that initiates one or many payments depending on the conditions set in the routing and exchange rate schemes.

- Invoice

    > A **Payment Invoice** is a high-level operation that initiates accompanying Payment Request and Ledger account transactions.


The Payment Invoice includes information on the **_`amount`_**, **_`currency`_**, **_`service`_**, **_`commission`_**, **_`exchange rate`_** and other properties.
