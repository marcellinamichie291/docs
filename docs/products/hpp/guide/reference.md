### Metadata

|Key       |Description                                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`metadata`|Set of key/value pairs. Additional key:value info about your invoice.|

If you want to store additional/custom data at a resource's level, you can make use of PayCore.io's Metadata.

For example, if you're a data service provider and want to store certain features of a particular plan, say "Usage Limit", "Speed within limit", etc., you can store it in the Metadata of the Plan.

Metadata can be stored only as key-value array.

Considering the same example as above, if you want to store the additional features of a particular data plan here's what the JSON will look like:

```json
{  
    "metadata": {
        "usage-limit":"5GB",
        "speed-within-quota":"2MBbps",
        "post-usage-quota":"512kbps"
    }
}

```

!!! note
    -   Metadata is completely for your reference and will not be visible to customers.
    -   Metadata will not be a filter criteria, or a part of the exports.

## Handlers

HPP dispatches events which can be handled for various purposes. The table below provides the full list of events that you can attach one or more handlers to.

!!! note
    Event constants on the JavaScript API are accessible via `HPP.Events`.

### Basic events

### Widget events

| Event | JavaScript constant | When |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | `READY` | Triggered when HPP is registered on the global namespace and safe to use.|
| `frameActivated` | `FRAME_ACTIVATED` | Triggered when the form is rendered.|
| `cardValidationChanged` | `CARD_VALIDATION_CHANGED` | Triggered when the state of the card form validation changes. This will return: `isValid: true / false` |
| `cardSubmitted` | `CARD_SUBMITTED` | Triggered when the card form has been submitted.|
| `cardTokenised` | `CARD_TOKENISED` | Triggered after a card is tokenized. Returns an object containing the card token and card information such as payment methods, expiration date, the first 6 (bin) and last 4 digits of the credit card. |
| `cardTokenisationFailed` | `CARD_TOKENISATION_FAILED` | Triggered if card tokenization fails. |


### Adding an event handler

There are two ways to add an event handler: the standard approach or configuration options.

-   Method 1: The standard approach  
    ```
    Checkout.addEventHandler(Checkout.Events.<EVENT_CONSTANT>, handler, options);
    ```
-   Method 2: Configuration options
    ```
    HPP.init({
      publicKey: 'pk_test_6ff46046-30af-41d9-bf58-929022d2cd14',
      <eventName>: handler
    });
    ```
