## What happens when my customer's immediate checkout amount is different from the subscription amount?

Chargebee provides a detail summary on the current charge and the recurring charge in case there is a difference in terms of the amount.

Let's take this example: Consider you selling a Ebook subscription. The cost of the subscription is $10 and there is an additional deposit of $5 that must be paid for the first month alone. You can create this deposit as a non recurring add-on and add it as a mandatory add-on for the plan.  [Read more on this here.](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/auto-addons.html)

When your customer check's out he will first see the  **Orders**  screen. The  **Orders**  screen will display the charge of the subscription, the total amount that they will have to Pay now, and the amount that they will have to pay when the subscription renews.
