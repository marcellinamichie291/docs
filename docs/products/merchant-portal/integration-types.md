## [#](#overview)Overview

The Chargebee Self-Serve Portal allows your end customers to manage their accounts and subscriptions by themselves. Unlike other vendors,  **our self-serve portal can be opened inside your app rather than redirecting to a different page**.

These are the below actions which your end customers can perform,

-   View/Edit account details
-   View/Download invoices
-   View/Edit subscription details
-   View/Edit payment details
-   View/Edit billing and shipping details
-   Cancel/Reactivate thier subscription
