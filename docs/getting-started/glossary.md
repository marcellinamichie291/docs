### 2FA

**Two-factor authentication**(2FA) is a security process which requires users to provide two means of identification before accessing their account.

The two levels of security are your password and a unique special code generated by an authentication app, installed on your smartphone. The two most popular authentication apps are Google Authenticator and Authy.

If you have 2FA enabled, you will receive a temporary 6-digit code which can be used only for a very short period of time: about 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the code will expire and a new code will be generated. The requirement to enter both your password and this 6-digit code makes your account better protected. Even if your password is compromised (make sure to never reveal it to anyone!), your account cannot be accessed without direct access to your mobile device.

You can enable 2FA from in account preferences.

### 3-D Secure

**3-D Secure** (3-domain structure), also known as a payer authentication, is a security protocol that helps to prevent fraud in online credit and debit card transactions. This additional security was initiated and created by Visa and MasterCard and it’s branded as ‘Verified by Visa’ and ‘MasterCard SecureCode’ respectively.


The payer authentication is a three-part process, so there are three parties involved in the process: the issuer (such as Visa or MasterCard), the acquirer, and the interoperability domain (such as payment system).

#### How 3D Secure works
When you, as a merchant, have 3D Secure enabled on your website and your customer uses the card that is enrolled in the 3D Secure program the process looks as follows:

1. The customer enters their credit or debit card information in the payment form
2. SecurionPay contacts a directory server and gets the message that the card is registered in the program
3. The customer sees the 3D Secure page when they need to authenticate themselves to the issuing bank by entering the password or a one time PIN
4. The result of the 3D Secure authentication goes to SecurionPay and then we submit transaction details to the acquiring bank
5. The transaction is authorized by the acquirer
6. The customer can see the response about whether the transaction is successful or failed
