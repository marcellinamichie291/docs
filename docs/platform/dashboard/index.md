## Overview

The [PayCore.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.paycore.io/) is a feature-rich user interface for you to operate and configure your PayCore.io account. You can use it to manage payments and payouts, respond to incidents, monitor your integration, and more.

The Dashboard home page provides useful at-a-glance information about the activity on your account. A wide range of analytics and real-time charts provide insight into the performance of your business. The Dashboard also shows recent activity that may require you to take action, such as unanswered disputes or identity verifications.
